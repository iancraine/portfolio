      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello my name is Ian Craine and ever since I first opened my grandma's 5yr old laptop
        I've had an interest in learning to create anything with technology, whether it be how
        my favorite games or songs were made or teaching myself how to create logos and videos
        through youtube tutorials.
        In my previous role in online grocery, my team and I would regularly handle a high volume
        of orders while still remaining one of the top stores in the market. This sharpened my skills
        in not only teamwork but also customer satisfaction. These skills along with my passion for
        technology led me to a career in software development where I can use my strengths in adaptability
        and futuristic thinking in order to improve a system bigger than just me!
        I am looking for a position where I would be able to see the results of my hard work while also
        furthering my knowledge in development. Thank you!
      </p>
